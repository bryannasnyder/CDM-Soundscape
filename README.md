# CDM-Soundscape
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bryannasnyder
- This soundscape tells the story of the Gaeilge language. It begins as a language and slowly takes hold.
- Then England comes and occupies Ireland. English takes over as the main language.
- The Great Famine also affected the language.
- Ireland gains its independence. They prioritize bringing the language back and make it the official language.
- Thank you!
